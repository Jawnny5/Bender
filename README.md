# BENDER

Demo Project - Bender(Tinder Clone) by William Neal

**BENDER** Bender is a "Tinder Clone" built in Expo/React Native & the React Gesture Library.


<h1>How to Install and run</h1>

Visit [Bender]https://github.com/Jawnny5/Bender and clone the repository down into a local directory. Navigate to the directory and enter the command. Once inside the directory, run the command `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies for the project to run. Finally, run the command "npm run start" to start the application.

 Bender only has a few features as it is mostly a demo project to familiarize myself with "swiping" or gesture handling inside of Native Applications.


<h1>Using the Application</h1>
   **Swiping Right** Will "like" a user and render a notification briefly to the client that the "like" was successful.

   **Swiping Left** Will "diss" a user and render a notification briefly to the client that the "diss" was successful.

   **Heart Button** Provides the same functionality as "swiping right".
